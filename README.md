# Healthcare Analytics Dashboard - Power BI & SQL

## Description
The **Healthcare Analytics Dashboard** is a Power BI project designed to analyze patient data, hospital performance, and treatment records. It helps healthcare organizations track patient demographics, monitor readmission rates, and analyze treatment efficiency, providing real-time insights to drive better decision-making.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive visualizations of patient demographics, treatment history, and hospital performance.
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track **Readmission Rate**, **Average Length of Stay**, and **Treatment Costs**.
- Drill-through functionality for detailed analysis of individual patients and treatments.
- Real-time data integration from SQL databases to ensure up-to-date reporting.
- Data-driven insights to support healthcare operations and improve patient outcomes.

## Features
- **Patient Demographics**: Breakdown of patient information like age, gender, and region.
- **Readmission Rate**: Monitor and track the rate of patient readmissions.
- **Average Length of Stay (ALOS)**: Analyze the average time patients spend in the hospital.
- **Treatment Performance**: Visualization of treatment efficiency across different categories.
- **Hospital Performance**: KPIs for the overall performance of the hospital in terms of patient outcomes.
- **Regional Analysis**: Drill-through reports to analyze hospital performance by region.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. **Power BI Desktop** - [Download Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
2. **SQL Server** or **SQL Database** - Make sure the SQL database containing healthcare data is accessible.
### Steps to Set Up the Project:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `HealthcareAnalyticsDashboard.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Configure the **SQL Server connection** in Power BI to point to your patient data database:
   - In Power BI, go to **Home** > **Transform Data** > **Data Source Settings**.
   - Set up your SQL connection with the correct credentials.
4. If using Excel or CSV files for additional data, configure the file paths accordingly.
5. Click **Refresh** to load the data and ensure real-time updates.
## Usage
- **KPIs**: View key performance indicators like **Readmission Rate**, **ALOS**, and **Treatment Costs**.
- **Charts**: Interact with visualizations such as **bar charts** for hospital performance and **pie charts** for patient demographics.
- **Slicers**: Filter data by **age**, **gender**, **region**, and other variables to gain deeper insights.
- **Drill-through Reports**: Use the drill-through functionality to analyze individual patient data and explore treatment records.
- **Trend Analysis**: Visualize patient admission trends over time using line charts.
